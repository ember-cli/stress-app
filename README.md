# Stress-app

This app aims to be a stress test for ember-cli.
We will contiue to add scenarios that make it slow, then make it fast again



[issues](https://github.com/ember-cli/stress-app/issues/) are going to track known issues with this app
[ember-cli/issues](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aperformance) is meant for perf issues that in ember-cli but are likely described by a scenario here.

## Current state:

This app really doesn't contain many app or test files yet, rather is mostly focused on a specific issues:

* many app.imports (lets get the number)
* very large bower_components dir (80,000k+ files â€“ we hit a pathalogical scenario here that is now largely fixed)
* ... (lets keep this up to date)

[We clearly need more files](https://github.com/ember-cli/stress-app/issues/2) to really start to represent real apps.

## Progress so far
